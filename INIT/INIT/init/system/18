kill <PID>

#If you have more than one process id, you can kill all of them together by providing all the PIDs.
#sudo kill process_id_1 process_id_2 process_id_3

#or
# sudo kill -9 `pidof programe_name` 
#To know PID
# pidof <program_name>
#or
#ps aux | grep -i “name of your desired program”
#ps aux command returns all the running process on the system. And the grep afterwards shows the line which matches with the program name.

#killall program_name
